In the wake of the [[Pre History]] era, [[Eldoria]] transitioned into a new phase of its existence, marked by the resurgence of ancient conflicts, the rise of new powers, and the discovery of hidden realms. From the end of that section to the present time, a dynamic tapestry of events unfolded, shaping the world and setting the stage for the epic battles that would ensue in the TCG.

After the near [[extinction event]], the [[Raqunes]] found themselves facing a period of rebuilding and exploration. Their societies sought to expand their knowledge, pushing the boundaries of magic, technology, and understanding the cosmos. Explorers and adventurers set out to chart unexplored territories, uncovering ancient ruins and artifacts that revealed glimpses of forgotten civilizations and lost knowledge.

During their explorations, the Raqunes encountered other sentient species, each with their own unique cultures, histories, and ambitions. Interactions between these races ranged from peaceful alliances and trade to rivalries and conflicts over territory and resources. As the Raqunes and the other species vied for supremacy, a power struggle emerged, fuelled by the desire to control the ethereal resources bestowed by the [[Shadowsouls]].

These resources, obtained through the [[Shadow Pacts]], became a catalyst for conflict. The Shadowsouls, once revered as mystical entities, began to exert their influence over the Raqunes, demanding greater sacrifices and pledging their loyalty to those who could harness their power effectively. The Raqunes, driven by ambition, sought to dominate the ethereal realm and control the flow of resources, leading to fierce battles and strategic manoeuvres in their pursuit of supremacy.

As the conflict escalated, a new breed of individuals arose: [[champions and heroes]] who embraced the call to arms. These warriors, representing different races and factions, honed their skills, mastering the arts of combat, magic, and strategic tactics. They became renowned figures, leading armies, or venturing out as solitary mercenaries, each driven by their own motivations and aspirations.

In the present time of Eldoria, the world stands at a precipice. The Raqunes, along with their allies and rivals, continue to vie for control, seeking to manipulate the ethereal realm and harness its powers for their own ends. The TCG emerges as a reflection of this ongoing struggle, where players embody the champions and commanders of these factions, engaging in intense battles, strategic manoeuvres, and the pursuit of dominance.

The battles in the TCG serve as a representation of the conflicts that unfold in the world of Eldoria. Players harness the abilities and strengths of their chosen races and factions, utilizing strategic gameplay and tactical decision-making to outwit their opponents. The ethereal resources, tied to the Shadowsouls and their enigmatic powers, play a central role, fuelling the magical and technological advancements that shape the outcomes of the battles.
