In the pre-history of Eldoria, an era shrouded in the mists of time, the Raqunes underwent a remarkable journey of evolution and faced unprecedented trials. It was a period of grandeur, conflict, resilience, and ultimately, the dawn of a new age. Here is a descriptive tale of this ancient era:

Long ago, after the Aetherfall and the infusion of the Keepers' consciousness, the Raqunes emerged as sentient beings. They carried within them the essence of the ancient ethereal beings, inheriting their wisdom and purpose. From their humble origins as raccoon-like creatures, the Raqunes embarked on a transformative path, evolving both physically and intellectually.

As the Raqunes developed their newfound sentience, they faced the tumultuous years of the Great War. Factions emerged, each vying for dominance and control over the land. The clashes were fierce, fuelled by the passions and ideologies that had taken root within the clans. Blood was spilled, and devastation marred the once pristine landscapes of Eldoria.

Amidst the chaos and destruction, a wise and charismatic leader emerged, bringing together representatives from all the clans. This visionary figure sought to end the war and restore harmony to Eldoria. Through diplomacy, compromise, and the forging of alliances, a great peace accord was reached. The clans, weary from the conflict, embraced this opportunity for reconciliation.

In the aftermath of the war, Eldoria experienced a period of rejuvenation and reconstruction. The Raqunes, guided by their shared history and the wisdom of their ancestors, laid the foundations for a new era of prosperity and coexistence. The societies flourished, and advancements in technology, magic, and culture marked this golden age.

However, this era of peace was not without its trials. Eldoria faced a near extinction event, a catastrophic occurrence that threatened to wipe out all life on the planet. The nature and cause of this event remain mysterious, lost to the annals of history. The Raqunes, facing the brink of oblivion, rallied together, drawing upon their collective strength and resourcefulness to survive.

During this time, the Raqunes forged Shadow Pacts, entering into mystical agreements with enigmatic entities known as the Shadowsouls. These powerful beings, residing in the shadowy depths of Eldoria, granted the Raqunes access to the ethereal realm and its mystical resources. The Shadow Pacts became a crucial aspect of the Raqunes' society, enabling them to harness and utilize the energies of the Shadowsouls to further their endeavours.

Through their resilience and ingenuity, the Raqunes persevered, ensuring the survival of their kind. This period of near extinction served as a turning point, shaping the Raqunes' perspective on the fragility of life and the importance of unity.

As the pre-history era drew to a close, the Raqunes prepared to usher in a new chapter in Eldoria's history. The echoes of the Great War, the peace accord, the near extinction event, and the profound significance of the Shadow Pacts would reverberate throughout the ages, leaving an indelible mark on the Raqune civilization and setting the stage for the adventures and conflicts yet to come.
