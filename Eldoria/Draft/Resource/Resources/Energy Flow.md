##### Energy Flow is a unique resource system in the game that represents the dynamic and fluctuating energy currents that permeate the world of [[Eldoria (world)]]. It serves as an early-game resource, providing players with the means to initiate battles, play cards, and establish their strategies. Here's a detailed explanation of how Energy Flow functions in the game:

- **Acquiring Energy Flow:** Energy Flow is the primary resource available to players at the beginning of the game. Each player starts with a base amount of Energy Flow, which can be further increased through various game mechanics, card effects, or special actions. It represents the fundamental energy that fuels players' actions and allows them to interact with the game world.
- **Energy Flow Cards:** Energy Flow cards are an essential component of players' decks. These cards represent the spells, abilities, creatures, and [[resources]] that players can deploy using their Energy Flow. They have varying Energy Flow costs associated with them, reflecting their impact on the game and the amount of energy required to activate them.
- **Energy Flow Pool:** Players have a dedicated pool or track to track their Energy Flow resource. This pool starts at the base amount and increases or decreases throughout the game based on player actions, card effects, or other game mechanics. The rate at which Energy Flow is generated or consumed can be influenced by the strategic choices players make.
- **Card Limitation:** To manage the pace and balance of the game, there may be limitations on the number of cards players can play during the early game. This restriction encourages players to carefully consider their choices and prioritize the cards they deem most valuable or strategically significant. It adds a layer of tactical decision-making and resource management to the gameplay.
- **Early Game Strategies:** Energy Flow serves as the foundation for players' early game strategies. They must carefully allocate their Energy Flow [[resources]] to play cards, summon creatures, cast spells, and initiate battles. It allows players to establish board presence, develop their strategies, and gain an advantage over their opponents.
- **Resource Generation and Conversion:** Some cards or game mechanics may allow players to generate additional Energy Flow or convert it into other [[resources]], such as [[Elemental Essence]] or [[Draft/Resource/Resources/Shadow Pacts]]. These options provide players with flexibility and strategic choices, allowing them to adapt their gameplay based on the evolving game state and their long-term objectives.
- **Tempo and Momentum:** Energy Flow management is crucial in determining the game's tempo and momentum. Players who can efficiently generate and utilize their Energy Flow will have a greater advantage in establishing control, pressuring opponents, and dictating the flow of the game. Skilful resource management and understanding the ebb and flow of Energy Flow are key to success.
- **Transition to Other [[Resources]]:** As the game progresses, Energy Flow may become less prominent compared to other [[resources]] like [[Elemental Essence]] or [[Draft/Resource/Resources/Shadow Pacts]]. It represents the transition from early to mid and late-game strategies, where players rely on additional [[resources]] and mechanics to achieve victory.

By incorporating the Energy Flow resource system, the game introduces players to the foundational mechanics, encourages strategic decision-making, and establishes the tempo and flow of the gameplay. It provides a framework for early-game battles, card plays, and strategic manoeuvres, setting the stage for more intricate and advanced gameplay as the game unfolds.
