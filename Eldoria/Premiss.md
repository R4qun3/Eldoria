1. **Game Concept:** 
   Eldoria is a trading card game (TCG) set in a world (Eldoria) where anthropomorphized raccoon creatures called [[Raqunes]], along with other creatures, engage in battles and harness mystical powers.

    - **Incantation Cards**: Unleash one-time spell effects that impact the game state, such as dealing damage, providing buffs, or altering rules.
    - **Relic Cards**: Depict powerful artifacts found in the Eldoria universe, providing additional abilities, enhancing creatures, or triggering special effects.
    - **Enigma Cards**: Persistent enchantments that modify rules or enhance creatures, remaining on the battlefield.
    - **Epic Event Cards**: Symbolize significant occurrences or pivotal moments, introducing temporary effects, triggering conditions, or providing unexpected twists.
      
3. **Resource System:** [[Shadow Pacts]]
    - **Shadow Pact Cards**: Represent mystical entities [[Raqunes]] forge dark pacts with, providing unique abilities.
    - **Pact Energy**: Generated by fulfilling conditions or triggering events tied to Shadow Pact cards.
    - **Pact Energy Pool**: Accumulated energy used to cast spells, activate abilities, or summon creatures associated with the chosen Shadow Pact.

    - **Life Total**: Reduce the opponent's life total to zero.
    - **Objective-based**: Achieve specific objectives or tasks during gameplay.
    - Victory Points: Accumulate the highest number of victory points based on actions and achievements.
    - **Lasting Dominance**: Establish overwhelming control or achieve a specific condition representing dominance.
    - **Lore-based Challenges**: Successfully complete lore-inspired scenarios or quests.
      
5. **Deck Construction:** 
   Players can construct decks using a combination of [[Raqunes]], creatures, spells, and other card types, within specific deck-building restrictions. Deck size, card ratios, rarity considerations, resource considerations, and synergy/themes are important aspects of deck construction.
