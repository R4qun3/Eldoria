## Brainstorm the key elements and mechanics of the game

### [[Resource System]]
Similar to MTG, you can implement a mana-based resource system where players generate resources to cast spells and deploy creatures. This can add depth to gameplay and strategic decision-making.

### Card Types
there will be five card types. Here are some suggestions:
- **[[Creature Cards]]:** These cards represent Raqunes, other creatures from the Eldoria universe, or anthropomorphized animals. They have power and toughness values, abilities, and unique characteristics.
- **[[Incantation Cards]]:** Incantation cards represent the spells in the game. They unleash one-time effects that can impact the game state, such as dealing damage, providing temporary buffs, or altering the rules.
- **[[Relic Cards]]:** Relic cards depict powerful artifacts found in the Eldoria universe. They can be wielded or interacted with by Raqunes, providing additional abilities, enhancing creatures, or triggering special effects.
- **[[Enigma Cards]]:** Enigma cards embody mystical enchantments that persistently modify the game's rules or enhance creatures. They remain on the battlefield, weaving mysterious and captivating effects.
- **[[Epic Event Cards]]:** Epic Event cards symbolize significant occurrences or pivotal moments in the game. They introduce temporary effects, trigger specific conditions, or provide unexpected twists that shape the course of the game.

### [[Combat and Interactions]]
Develop a combat system where creatures can attack opponents directly or engage in battles with other creatures. Consider mechanics like summoning sickness, blocking, trample, and flying to add tactical choices and strategic depth.

### [[Keywords and Abilities]]
Create a range of keywords and abilities that make each card unique and add depth to gameplay. Examples could include abilities like "Scavenge" (gaining benefits from discarded cards) or "Rummage" (drawing cards by discarding).

### [[Deck Construction]]
Allow players to build their decks using a combination of Raqunes, creatures, spells, and other card types within certain deck-building restrictions. This promotes strategic planning and customization.

### [[Turn Structure]]
Define a clear turn structure that includes phases for drawing, resource generation, playing cards, attacking, and resolving effects. This helps maintain a smooth and organized gameplay flow.

### [[Win Conditions]]
Determine win conditions, such as reducing the opponent's life total to zero (similar to MTG), achieving specific objectives, or accumulating victory points.
