**Aurumliks plan**: 
The Aurumliks are a race of highly intelligent and innovative beings within the Eldoria universe. They have a deep fascination with technology, constantly seeking to push the boundaries of what is possible. The origins of the Aurumliks can be traced back to a time when they were an isolated clan of raccoon-like creatures. Through their natural curiosity and innate problem-solving abilities, they discovered ancient relics and artifacts left behind by a technologically advanced civilization that once existed in the Eldoria world.

**Solyrians**: 
Solyrians are Raqunes who have adapted to the scorching desert regions of Eldoria. Their fur ranges from sandy beige to deep ochre, blending with the arid landscapes. They possess exceptional endurance, able to withstand extreme temperatures and traverse vast distances. Solyrians are known for their resourcefulness and survival skills, often forming nomadic clans. Their societies value independence and self-sufficiency, but rivalries over limited resources can lead to occasional conflicts.

**Umbralites**: 
Umbralites are a nocturnal race of Raqunes who inhabit the shadowy regions of Eldoria. Their fur is dark and often possesses patterns resembling constellations. They have heightened senses in darkness and possess mysterious shadow manipulation abilities. Umbralites are known for their affinity for ancient magic and mysticism. Their societies are secretive, often dwelling in hidden enclaves or underground cities. Umbralites face the constant challenge of balancing their affinity for shadows with the light-favoured races, leading to misunderstandings and prejudices.

**Verdantfolk**: 
The Verdantfolk are Raqunes who reside in the lush, verdant regions of Eldoria. They have vibrant and varied fur colours, reflecting the diversity of the natural landscapes they call home. Verdantfolk possess an innate connection with plants and possess the ability to manipulate flora to their advantage. They excel in herbalism, plant-based magic, and have a deep understanding of the natural world. Verdantfolk societies are often organized around harmonious coexistence with nature, and they play a vital role in preserving the balance of the ecosystems. However, their pacifist nature can lead to conflicts with races that prioritize conquest or exploitation.

**Stonewalkers**: 
Stonewalkers are Raqunes adapted to the rugged mountainous regions of Eldoria. Their fur patterns resemble the textures and colours of stones, allowing them to blend seamlessly with rocky environments. They possess enhanced strength and resilience, making them skilled climbers and formidable warriors. Stonewalkers have a deep affinity for the earth, with the ability to manipulate and harness its power. They have structured societies based on honour, loyalty, and the pursuit of physical and mental mastery. Their strong sense of justice and defence of their territories often lead to conflicts with those who encroach upon their mountain homes.
