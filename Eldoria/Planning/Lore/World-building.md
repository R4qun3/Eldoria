**World of Contrasts:** 
The world of Eldoria is a tapestry of contrasting landscapes and cultures. From ancient mystical forests where ancient spirits dwell to sprawling futuristic cities pulsating with technological advancements, Eldoria encompasses a myriad of realms and civilizations. Desert clans roam the arid wastelands, while hidden enclaves exist in the depths of underground caverns. Each variant of Raqunes represents a unique aspect of this diverse world, with its own strengths, weaknesses, and attributes.

**[[The Cataclysm and Awakening]]:** 
In a forgotten age, ethereal beings known as the Keepers watched over the world, maintaining balance and harmony. However, an unforeseen catastrophe, now known as the "Aetherfall," was unleashed by the Keepers themselves. This cataclysm wiped out the Keepers but transferred their consciousness into select creatures, including the Raqunes, awakening them with sentience and purpose. The Aetherfall shattered the world, leaving remnants of their power scattered throughout.

**Evolution and Trials:** 
Over the course of the next 3000 years, the Raqunes underwent a remarkable evolution. They faced wars, periods of peace, and near extinction, all shaping their culture and societies. In their journey, the Raqunes discovered ancient relics infused with the residual power of the Keepers, granting them unique abilities and connections to the mystical energies of the world. The Raqunes learned to harness these powers to survive and thrive, forging their own destinies.

**[[Cultures and Orders]]:** 
Instead of using colours, Raqunes is defined by a diverse array of cultures and orders that represent different aspects of the world. Each culture embodies distinct philosophies, traditions, and magical practices. For example, the Verdant Circle reveres nature and the primal forces of the wild, while the Technomancers are masters of technological innovation and harness the energies of machinery. Other cultures and orders could include the Celestial Scribes, Shadowweavers, or Stormcallers, each with their own unique abilities and playstyles.

**Mystical Phenomena and Wonders:** 
The world of Raqunes is filled with mystical phenomena and wonders. These include mysterious ley lines that crisscross the land, ancient ruins hiding forgotten knowledge, and sacred groves brimming with elemental energies. Enigmatic creatures and spirits roam the lands, some serving as guardians and guides, while others are formidable adversaries. The Raqunes interact with these phenomena, drawing power from them and unravelling the secrets they hold.

**Tone and Atmosphere:** 
Eldoria strikes a tone that blends elements of grand adventure, epic battles, and a touch of light-heartedness. It captures the awe-inspiring magic and vastness of worlds like Lord of the Rings and the strategic battles of games like Magic: The Gathering. The lore embraces the notion of heroes rising from humble origins, facing immense challenges, and discovering their true potential. Humour is infused through interactions between characters, witty dialogue, and occasional playful references, adding charm and levity to the overall experience.
