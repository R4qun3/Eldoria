# <u>Combat System Outline:</u>

The combat system in Eldoria is designed to provide tactical choices and strategic depth during battles between creatures. It incorporates mechanics such as summoning sickness, blocking, trample, and flying to create engaging gameplay scenarios. Here's an outline of how the combat system works:

1. **[[Engagement Phase]]:** 
   The engagement phase is where combat takes place. During a player's turn, they can choose to initiate combat with their creatures.
    
2. **[[Attack Declaration]]:** 
   The active player selects which of their creatures will attack. Each creature can attack only once per engagement phase. The attacking creatures become tapped to signify their readiness for battle.
    
3. **[[Block Declaration]]:** 
   The defending player chooses which of their creatures, if any, will block the attacking creatures. Each defending creature can block only one attacking creature.
    
4. **[[Combat Resolution]]:** 
   Once the blockers are declared, combat damage is resolved simultaneously. Each attacking creature deals damage equal to its power to the defending creature it's blocking (if any), and vice versa. Creatures with zero or less toughness are destroyed and placed in their owner's graveyard.
    
5. **[[Trample]]:** 
   Some creatures may possess the Trample ability. When a creature with Trample attacks and is blocked, any excess damage it deals beyond the toughness of the defending creature can be assigned to the defending player. This allows for strategic decision-making, as players must weigh the potential damage to blockers against dealing damage to the opponent.
    
6. **[[Flying]]:** 
   Certain creatures may have the Flying ability, enabling them to bypass ground-based blockers. Flying creatures can only be blocked by other creatures with flying or reach, adding an aerial element to the combat system.
    
7. **[[Combat Enhancements]]:** 
   Players can use various combat-enhancing cards or abilities to modify the outcome of combat. These cards might provide temporary boosts to power and toughness, grant additional combat phases, or alter the combat rules in unique ways.
    
8. **[[Combat Tricks and Instant Effects]]:** 
   Players can utilize instant cards or activated abilities during combat to surprise opponents and influence the outcome. These cards may grant temporary bonuses, alter the power and toughness of creatures, or introduce unexpected combat mechanics, creating opportunities for strategic manoeuvring.
    
9. **[[Creature Abilities and Interactions]]:** 
   Each creature may possess unique abilities that can impact combat. These abilities could include First Strike (dealing damage before non-First Strike creatures), Deathtouch (destroying creatures with any amount of damage), or Lifelink (gaining life equal to the damage dealt), among others. These abilities add depth and variability to combat scenarios.
    
10. **[[Combat Result and Consequences]]:** 
    After combat, players evaluate the damage dealt to creatures and players. Destroyed creatures are placed in their owner's graveyard. If a player's life total reaches zero or below, they are defeated. Successful combat strategies can lead to victory, while unsuccessful attacks or defences can leave players vulnerable.
