1. **Gathered Essence:** 
   Players tap into the innate essence of the Raqune creatures to power their spells and abilities. Each Raqune has a unique essence type, such as Swift, Cunning, Wise, Brave, and Mystic. Players generate gathered essence by controlling Raqunes with different essence types on the battlefield. This essence can be spent to cast spells and activate abilities that align with the corresponding essence type.
    
2. **Natural Elements:** 
   The resource system revolves around harnessing the power of natural elements present in the Raqunes' environment. There are various elemental types, such as Forest, River, Mountain, Sky, and Underground. Players generate elemental energy by controlling specific Raqunes or playing elemental cards. This energy can be accumulated and used to cast spells and summon creatures tied to the corresponding elements.
    
3. **[[Shadow Pacts]]:** 
   Raqunes tap into dark pacts with mystical entities to gain access to arcane power. Players create and manage Shadow Pacts by forming contracts with different entities. Each entity grants a specific power or ability, and players generate Shadow Pact energy by fulfilling conditions or triggering certain events. This energy can be utilized to cast spells and activate abilities associated with the chosen Shadow Pact.
    
4. **Soul Connections:** 
   Raqunes establish profound soul connections with fellow creatures, which serve as a source of power. Players generate Soul Connections by forming bonds between Raqunes on the battlefield. These connections create a network of shared energy, allowing players to tap into it and cast spells or activate abilities that leverage the strength of the connected Raqunes.
