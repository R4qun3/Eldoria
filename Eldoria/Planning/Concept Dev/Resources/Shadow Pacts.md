1. **[[Shadow Pact Cards]]:** 
   Shadow Pact cards represent the mystical entities with whom Raqunes forge dark pacts. These cards have unique abilities and effects associated with them. Players include Shadow Pact cards in their decks as a core component of their resource strategy.
    
2. **[[Pact Energy]]:** 
   Each Shadow Pact card grants a specific type of energy, such as Shadow Energy, Dark Energy, or Forbidden Energy. Players generate pact energy by fulfilling conditions or triggering specific events tied to their Shadow Pact cards. For example, defeating an opponent's creature or casting certain spells may generate pact energy.
    
3. **[[Pact Energy Pool]]:** 
   Players have a pact energy pool that represents their accumulated pact energy throughout the game. The energy pool can be used to cast spells, activate abilities, or summon powerful creatures associated with the chosen Shadow Pact. The amount of pact energy available depends on the number and type of Shadow Pact cards in the player's deck.
    
4. **[[Strategic Management]]:** 
   Players need to strategically manage their pact energy resources. They must decide when to use pact energy for casting powerful spells, activating abilities, or summoning high-cost creatures. Balancing resource expenditure and timing becomes crucial for maximizing the effectiveness of the chosen Shadow Pact.
    
5. **[[Shadow Pact Interactions]]:** 
   Some Eldoria creatures or other cards may interact with the Shadow Pact resource system. They might have abilities that generate or manipulate pact energy, allowing players to further optimize their resource generation or disrupt their opponents' plans.
