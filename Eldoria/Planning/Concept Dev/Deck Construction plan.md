1. **Deck Size:** 
   Players construct their decks with a predetermined deck size, such as 60 cards. This deck size helps maintain a balance between consistency and variety in gameplay.
    
2. **Card Types and Ratios:** 
   Players can include a variety of card types in their decks, such as Raqunes, creatures, spells, and other card types based on the Eldoria game mechanics. Deck-building restrictions may specify minimum and maximum card counts for each type to ensure a well-rounded deck.
    
3. **Rarity and Power Level:** 
   Eldoria can incorporate a rarity system for cards, such as common, uncommon, rare, and mythic rare. Players can build their decks with a combination of cards from different rarities to add depth and strategic choices. However, restrictions on the number of high-power or rare cards may be imposed to maintain balance.
    
4. **Resource Considerations:** 
   Since Eldoria uses the Shadow Pacts resource system, players may need to consider including a balance of Shadow Pact cards and other support cards that generate or interact with pact energy. This ensures that players have access to the necessary resources throughout the game.
    
5. **Synergy and Themes:** 
   Players can focus on creating decks with specific synergies or themes. For example, a deck may revolve around a particular Raqune tribe or a specific playstyle like control, aggro, or combo. By including cards that work well together and support the chosen theme, players can maximize the effectiveness of their strategies.
    
6. **Deck-Building Restrictions:** 
   Raqunes may include certain deck-building restrictions to promote fair play and diverse gameplay. These restrictions may include limitations on the number of copies of certain powerful cards, banned or restricted card lists, or deck size variations for different game modes.
