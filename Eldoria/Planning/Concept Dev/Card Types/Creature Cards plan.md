1. **Creature Cards:** 
   Creature cards in "Eldoria" represent a variety of beings, including the anthropomorphized raccoon species known as Binfolk, as well as other creatures from the Eldoria universe and anthropomorphized animals. These cards showcase the diverse inhabitants of the world, each with their own unique characteristics and abilities.
    
    - **Power and Toughness:** 
      Each creature card has numerical values for power and toughness. Power represents the creature's offensive strength, indicating how much damage it deals when it attacks. Toughness represents the creature's defensive durability, indicating how much damage it can withstand before being destroyed.
        
    - **Abilities:** 
      Creature cards can possess a range of abilities that set them apart and influence gameplay. Abilities can be activated abilities that require a cost to activate, triggered abilities that automatically activate in response to certain events or conditions, or passive abilities that constantly affect the game. These abilities can grant advantages to the player, alter the state of the battlefield, or impact other cards and players.
        
    - **Interaction with Other Cards:** 
      Creature cards can interact with other cards in various ways. They can have synergies with specific types of spells, artifacts, or enchantments, allowing for strategic combinations and interactions. Some creature cards may also have abilities that trigger when they enter or leave the battlefield, enabling interesting interactions and tactical choices.
        
    - **Summoning and Cost:** 
      Creature cards are typically cast by paying a cost, which may involve expending resources, sacrificing other cards, or meeting certain conditions. The cost reflects the effort or energy required to summon the creature onto the battlefield. More powerful creatures may have higher casting costs, requiring players to carefully manage their resources and strategic decisions.
        
    - **Flavour Text and Artwork:** 
      Each creature card features flavour text, a short snippet of descriptive text that provides additional context, story, or personality to the card. The artwork on the creature card visually represents the appearance and theme of the creature, helping to immerse players in the world of "Eldoria."
        
    - **Card Rarity:** 
      Creature cards, like other card types, can have different levels of rarity. Common creatures are more readily available and often have simpler abilities, while rare or legendary creatures are harder to obtain and tend to possess more unique or powerful abilities.
        
    - **Lore and Backstory:** 
      Creature cards contribute to the rich lore of "Eldoria." They can have individual stories, relationships, or affiliations that are explored in the game's lore. The lore behind each creature card adds depth and provides players with a deeper connection to the game's world.
