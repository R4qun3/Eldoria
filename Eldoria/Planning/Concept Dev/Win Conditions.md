1. **Life Total:** 
   The most common win condition is reducing the opponent's life total to zero. Each player starts with a set amount of life points, and players use their creatures, spells, and abilities to attack and deal damage to their opponents. The first player to reduce their opponent's life total to zero wins the game.
    
2. **Objective-based:** 
   Eldoria can introduce objective-based win conditions where players must achieve specific goals to win the game. These objectives can vary from game to game and may include tasks like controlling a certain number of creatures, playing specific cards, or fulfilling unique requirements tied to the lore and theme of Eldoria. The first player to complete the objective wins the game.
    
3. **Victory Points:** 
   Eldoria can utilize a victory point system where players earn points throughout the game based on their actions and achievements. These points can be earned by defeating opponents' creatures, casting powerful spells, or accomplishing certain milestones. The player with the highest number of victory points at the end of a specified number of turns or rounds wins the game.
    
4. **Lasting Dominance:** 
   Instead of a traditional win condition, Eldoria can incorporate a lasting dominance rule. The game continues until one player establishes overwhelming control or achieves a specific condition that signifies their dominance over the battlefield. For example, a player might win if they control a certain number of Eldoria creatures or have a significantly larger army than their opponent.
    
5. **Lore-based Challenges:** 
   Eldoria can introduce lore-based challenges where players engage in scenarios inspired by the rich lore of the universe. These challenges could involve facing powerful adversaries, overcoming environmental obstacles, or unravelling mysterious quests. The win condition is determined by successfully completing the challenge and progressing the story.
