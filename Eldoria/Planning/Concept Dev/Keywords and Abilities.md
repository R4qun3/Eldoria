1. **Scrounge:** 
   When a creature with Scrounge enters the battlefield, you may exile a card from your graveyard. If you do, put a +1/+1 counter on the creature. Scrounge allows creatures to draw strength from the discarded remains, growing more powerful as the battle rages on.
    
2. **Quickstep:** 
   Creatures with Quickstep have increased agility, allowing them to untap immediately after they deal combat damage to an opponent. This ability rewards aggressive strategies and provides opportunities for additional actions during a turn.
    
3. **Fleeting:** 
   Fleeting cards have a temporary presence on the battlefield. At the end of your turn, if a Fleeting card is still on the battlefield, exile it. This mechanic introduces ephemeral effects that players must strategically time and capitalize on before they vanish.
    
4. **Hoard:** 
   Creatures with Hoard can collect treasures or resources as they deal combat damage to opponents. These treasures can be used to pay for specific abilities or spells, providing resource generation and enabling unique strategic options.
    
5. **Pounce:** 
   Creatures with Pounce can attack as though they had haste if they haven't been blocked this turn. This ability allows creatures to swiftly strike before opponents can mount a proper defence, providing a surprise element and encouraging strategic timing of attacks.
    
6. **Infiltrate:** 
   Infiltrate enables creatures to bypass specific defences or restrictions. They can't be blocked by creatures with a higher power or toughness, or they can deal damage directly to an opponent even if they're blocked. This ability rewards strategic planning and enables clever tactical manoeuvres.
    
7. **Mimicry:** 
   Creatures with Mimicry can temporarily adopt the abilities of another target creature until end of turn. This ability allows for adaptability and encourages creative combinations, as creatures can borrow the strengths and abilities of their allies or foes.
    
8. **Shroudstrike:** 
   Creatures with Shroudstrike can only be blocked by creatures with shroud or hexproof. This ability represents a unique form of evasion, allowing creatures to bypass traditional blockers and strike directly at the opponent.
    
9. **Rummage:** 
   Players with Rummage abilities can discard a card and draw a card. This ability provides card filtering and allows players to dig deeper into their decks, finding the specific cards they need for their strategy.
    
10. **Conduit:** 
    Conduit cards have activated abilities that can be activated by paying an additional cost, such as tapping or sacrificing other permanents. These abilities may offer powerful effects or interactions, giving players additional options and customization within their strategies.
